 # The Four Seasons
 
 Hey there! Welcome to The Four Seasons, an extremely simple but delightful SpriteKit platformer experience.
 
 The moral of this Playground is to always "appreciate the journey". Life has so much to offer but we pay so little attention to the small things sometimes.
 
 You can move your character around by holding on the left or right halves of the screen.
 
 - Note: For the intended experience, please use in fullscreen landscape.
 
 Enjoy!
